# Tata_data_visualisation
This repo contains the solution of Task-3 of Tata Data Visualisation_virtual internship.

"Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights" is a virtual experience internship provided by Tata and Forage. The main motive of this virtual experience is to explore about data visualisation tools like Tableau and PowerBI and to make a report by using and data visualisation tool.
Here I had used Tableau for making the visuals.
This complete virtual internship contains four tasks, where first task is about framing the business scenario, task 2 is about learning about different visuals/charts and their uses, task 3 is about applying our knowledge and to make plots. Finally Task 4 is to present our visuals to the Tata Group.
